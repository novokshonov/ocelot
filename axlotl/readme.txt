The calculations were prepared in SRW and for area x = [-10 mm, 10 mm] and y = [-10 mm, 10 mm]. SigmaX and SigmaY of the beam are 169 um and 10 um relatively.

SRW_Ex_Int_from_electron.txt and SRW_Ey_Int_electron ---- files of intensities for horizontal and vertical polarizations calculated from one electron

SRW_Ex_field_Int_beam.txt and SRW_Ey_Int_beam ---- files of intensities for horizontal and vertical polarizations calculated from the whole beam (in SRW the whole beam picture is made by convolution of the one electron intensity picture and the beam distribution function)

IntX_one_Electron.png and IntY_one_Electron.pnd ---- saved pictures of intensities from one electron

IntX_whole_Beam.png and IntY_whole_Beam.png ---- saved pictures of intensities from the whole beam
